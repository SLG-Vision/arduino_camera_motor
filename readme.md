# Arduino camera tracker

Simple Arduino script to control the camera using a stepper motor.
The program reads a float from the serial port and rotates the stepper motor by an angle equal to the input.
A positive angle means a clockwise rotation, negative angle means anticlockwise.
Note that the motor has a sensibility of 2048 steps per revolution, which means that each step is about 0.175Â°.

The enclosure and the camera stand has been designed and 3d printed by ourselves.
